abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of optical indices from hyperspectral remote sensing in the assessment of vegetation biophysical variables both in forestry and agriculture. Those indices are, however, the combined response to variations of several vegetation and environmental properties, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content, canopy shadows, and background soil reflectance. Of particular significance to precision agriculture is chlorophyll content, an indicator of photosynthesis activity, which is related to the nitrogen concentration in green vegetation and serves as a measure of the crop response to nitrogen application. This paper presents a combined modeling and indices-based approach to predicting the crop chlorophyll content from remote sensing data while minimizing LAI (vegetation parameter) influence and underlying soil (background) effects. This combined method has been developed first using simulated data and followed by evaluation in terms of quantitative predictive capability using real hyperspectral airborne data. Simulations consisted of leaf and canopy reflectance modeling with PROSPECT and SAILH radiative transfer models. In this modeling study, we developed an index that integrates advantages of indices minimizing soil background effects and indices that are sensitive to chlorophyll concentration. Simulated data have shown that the proposed index Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) is both very sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and very resistant to the variations of LAI and solar zenith angle. It was therefore possible to generate a predictive equation to estimate leaf chlorophyll content from the combined optical index derived from above-canopy reflectance. This relationship was evaluated by application to hyperspectral CASI imagery collected over corn crops in three experimental farms from Ontario and Quebec, Canada. The results presented here are from the L'Acadie, Quebec, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada research site. Images of predicted leaf chlorophyll content were generated. Evaluation showed chlorophyll variability over crop plots with various levels of nitrogen, and revealed an excellent agreement with ground truth, with a correlation of r2=.81 between estimated and field measured chlorophyll content data. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Remote sensing of vegetation function and traits has advanced significantly over the past half-centuryin the capacity to retrieve useful plant biochemical, physiological and structural quantities across arange of spatial and temporal scales. However, the translation of remote sensing signals into mean-ingful descriptors of vegetation function and traits is still associated with large uncertainties due tocomplex interactions between leaf, canopy, and atmospheric mediums, and significant challenges in thetreatment of confounding factors in spectrum-trait relations. This editorial provides (1) a backgroundon major advances in the remote sensing of vegetation, (2) a detailed timeline and description of rel-evant historical and planned satellite missions, and (3) an outline of remaining challenges, upcomingopportunities and key research objectives to be tackled. The introduction sets the stage for thirteen Spe-cial Issue papers here that focus on novel approaches for exploiting current and future advancementsin remote sensor technologies.

abstract = {Earth is home to a remarkable diversity of plant forms and life histories, yet comparatively few essential trait combinations have proved evolutionarily viable in today's terrestrial biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three- quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to determine spectral bands that are best suited for characterizing agricultural crop biophysical variables. The data for this study comes from ground-level hyperspectral reflectance measurements of cotton, potato, soybeans, corn, and sunflower. Reflectance was measured in 490 discrete narrow bands between 350 and 1,050 nm. Observed crop characteristics included wet biomass, leaf area index, plant height, and (for cotton only) yield. Three types of hyperspectral predictors were tested: optimum multiple narrow band reflectance (OMNBR), narrow band normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) involving all possible two-band combinations of 490 channels, and the soil-adjusted vegetation indices. A critical problem with OMNBR models was that of “over fitting” (i.e., using more spectral channels than experimental samples to obtain a highly maximum R2 value). This problem was addressed by comparing the R2 values of crop variables with the R2 values computed for random data of a large sample size. The combinations of two to four narrow bands in OMNBR models explained most (64{\%} to 92{\%}) of the variability in crop biophysical variables. The second part of the paper describes a rigorous search procedure to identify the best narrow band NDVI predictors of crop biophysical variables. Special narrow band lambda ($\lambda$1) versus lambda ($\lambda$2) plots of R2 values illustrate the most effective wavelength combinations ($\lambda$1 and $\lambda$2) and bandwidths ($\Delta$$\lambda$1 and $\Delta$$\lambda$2) for predicting the biophysical quantities of each crop. The best of these two-band indices were further tested to see if soil adjustment or nonlinear fitting could improve their predictive accuracy. The best of the narrow band NDVI models explained 64{\%} to 88{\%} variability in different crop biophysical variables. A strong relationship with crop characteristics is located in specific narrow bands in the longer wavelength portion of the red (650 nm to 700 nm), with secondary clusters in the shorter wavelength portion of green (500 nm to 550 nm), in one particular section of the near-infrared (900 nm to 940 nm), and in the moisture sensitive near-infrared (centered at 982 nm). This study recommends a 12 narrow band sensor, in the 350 nm to 1,050 nm range of the spectrum, for optimum estimation of agricultural crop biophysical information.},

abstract = {Partial least squares (PLS) is a well known dimension reduction method which has been recently adapted for high dimensional classification problems in genome biology. We develop sparse versions of the recently proposed two PLS-based classification methods using sparse partial least squares (SPLS). These sparse versions aim to achieve variable selection and dimension reduction simultaneously. We consider both binary and multicategory classification. We provide analytical and simulation-based insights about the variable selection properties of these approaches and benchmark them on well known publicly available datasets that involve tumor classification with high dimensional gene expression data. We show that incorporation of SPLS into a generalized linear model (GLM) framework provides higher sensitivity in variable selection for multicategory classification with unbalanced sample sizes between classes. As the sample size increases, the two-stage approach provides comparable sensitivity with better specificity in variable selection. In binary classification and multicategory classification with balanced sample sizes, the two-stage approach provides comparable variable selection and prediction accuracy as the GLM version and is computationally more efficient. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging is usually acquired by satellite and aircraft platforms. Recently, miniaturized hyperspectral 2D frame cameras have showed great potential to precise agriculture estimations and they are feasible to combine with lightweight platforms, such as drones. Drone platform is a flexible tool for remote sensing applications with environment and agriculture. The assessment and comparison of different platforms such as satellite, aircraft and drones with different sensors, such as hyperspectral and RGB cameras is an important task in order to understand the potential of the data provided by these equipment and to select the most appropriate according to the user applications and requirements. In this context, open and permanent test fields are very significant and helpful experimental environment, since they provide a comparative data for different platforms, sensors and users, allowing multi-temporal analyses as well. Objective of this work was to investigate the feasibility of an open permanent test field in context of precision agriculture. Satellite (Sentinel-2), aircraft and drones with hyperspectral and RGB cameras were assessed in this study to estimate biomass, using linear regression models and in-situ samples. Spectral data and 3D information were used and compared in different combinations to investigate the quality of the models. The biomass estimation accuracies using linear regression models were better than 90{\&}thinsp;{\%} for the drone based datasets. The results showed that the use of spectral and 3D features together improved the estimation model. However, estimation of nitrogen content was less accurate with the evaluated remote sensing sensors. The open and permanent test field showed to be suitable to provide an accurate and reliable reference data for the commercial users and farmers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This hypothesis for estimating chlorophyll content at the leaf level was tested using simulations with the PROSAIL radiative transfer model and field spectroradiometry measurements in five consecutive years (2010–2014) for potato crops on experimental fields. During the growing season, in-situ field measurements of LAI and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) were performed.

abstract = {Visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with partial least squares (PLS) regression is a quick, cost-effective, and promising technology for predicting soil properties. The advantage of PLS regression is that all available wavebands can be incorporated in the model, while earlier studies indicate that PLS models include redundant wavelengths, and selecting specific wavebands can refine PLS analyses. This study evaluated the performance of PLS regression with waveband selection using Vis-NIR reflectance spectra to estimate the total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soils collected mainly from the surface of upland and lowland rice fields in Madagascar (n = 59; after outliers were removed). We used iterative stepwise elimination-based PLS (ISE-PLS) to estimate soil TC and TN and compared the predictive ability with standard full-spectrum PLS (FS-PLS). The predictive abilities were assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean squared error of cross-validation (RMSECV), and the residual predictive deviation (RPD). Overall, ISE-PLS using first derivative reflectance (FDR) showed a better predictive accuracy than ISE-PLS for both TC (R2 = 0.972, RMSECV = 0.194, RPD = 5.995) and TN (R2 = 0.949, RMSECV = 0.019, RPD = 4.416) in the soil of Madagascar. The important wavebands for estimating TC (12.59{\%} of all wavebands) and TN (3.55{\%} of all wavebands) were selected from all 2001 wavebands over the 400–2400 nm range using ISE-PLS. These findings suggest that ISE-PLS based on Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra can be used to estimate soil TC and TN contents in Madagascar with an improved predictive accuracy.},

abstract = {Plant responses to biotic and abiotic legacies left in soil by preceding plants is known as plant-soil feedback (PSF). PSF is an important mechanism to explain plant community dynamics and plant performance in natural and agricultural systems. However, most PSF studies are short-term and small-scale due to practical constraints for field scale quantification of PSF effects, yet field experiments are warranted to asses actual PSF effects under less controlled conditions. Here we used Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based optical sensors to test whether PSF effects on plant traits can be quantified remotely. We established a randomized agro-ecological field experiment in which six different cover crop species and species combinations from three different plant families (Poaceae, Fabaceae, Brassicaceae) were grown. The feedback effects on plant traits were tested in oat (Avena sativa) by quantifying the cover crop legacy effects on key plant traits: height, fresh biomass, nitrogen content and leaf chlorophyll content. Prior to destructive sampling, hyperspectral data was acquired and used for calibration and independent validation of regression models to retrieve plant traits from optical data. Subsequently, for each trait the model with highest precision and accuracy was selected. We used the hyperspectral analyses to predict the directly measured plant height (RMSE= 5.12 cm, R2= 0.79), chlorophyll content (RMSE= 0.11 g m{\&}minus;2, R2= 0.80), N-content (RMSE= 1.94 g m{\&}minus;2, R2= 0.68), and fresh biomass (RMSE= 0.72 kg m{\&}minus;2, R2= 0.56). Overall the PSF effects of the different cover crop treatments based on the remote sensing data matched the results based on in situ measurements. The average oat canopy was tallest and its leaf chlorophyll content highest in response to legacy of Vicia sativa monocultures (100 cm, 0.95 g m{\&}minus;2, respectively) and in mixture with Raphanus sativus (100 cm, 1.09 g m{\&}minus;2, respectively), while the lowest values (76 cm, 0.41 g m{\&}minus;2, respectively) were found in response to legacy of Lolium perenne monoculture, and intermediate responses to the legacy of the other treatments. We show that PSF effects in the field occur and alter several important plant traits that can be sensed remotely and quantified in a non-destructive way using UAV-based optical sensors; these can be repeated over the growing season to increase temporal resolution. Remote sensing thereby offers great potential for studying PSF effects at field scale and relevant spatial-temporal resolutions which will facilitate the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms.},

This paper introduces a new machine learning regression algorithms (MLRAs) toolbox into the scientific Automated Radiative Transfer Models Operator (ARTMO) software package. ARTMO facilitates retrieval of biophysical parameters from remote observations in a MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) environment. The MLRA toolbox enables analyzing the predictive power of various MLRAs in a semiautomatic and systematic manner, and applying a selected MLRA to multispectral or hyperspectral imagery for mapping applications. It contains both linear and nonlinear state-of-the-art regression algorithms, in particular linear feature extraction via principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), decision trees (DTs), neural networks (NNs), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and Gaussian processes regression (GPR). The performance of multiple implemented regression strategies has been evaluated against the SPARC dataset (Barrax, Spain) and simulated Sentinel-2 (8 bands), CHRIS (62 bands) and HyMap (125 bands) observations. In general, nonlinear regression algorithms (NN, KRR, and GPR) outperformed linear techniques (PCR and PLSR) in terms of accuracy, bias, and robustness. Most robust results along gradients of training/validation partitioning and noise variance were obtained by KRR while GPR delivered most accurate estimations. We applied a GPR model to a hyperspectral HyMap flightline to map LCC and LAI. We exploited the associated uncertainty intervals to gain insight in the per-pixel performance of the model. {\textcopyright} 2008-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Knipling1970,
abstract = {Knowledge of how solar radiation interacts with vegetation is necessary to interpret and process remote sensing data of agricultural and many natural resources. A plant leaf typically has a low reflectance in the visible spectral region because of strong absorption by chlorophylls, a relatively high reflectance in the near-infrared because of internal leaf scattering and no absorption, and a relatively low reflectance in the infrared beyond 1.3 $\mu$ because of strong absorption by water. The reflectance of a plant canopy is similar, but is modified by the nonuniformity of incident solar radiation, plant structures, leaf areas, shadows, and background reflectivities. Airborne sensors receive an integrated view of all these effects, and each crop or vegetation type tends to have a characteristic signature which permits its discrimination. When disease and physiological stresses directly affect the reflectance properties of individual leaves, the most pronounced initial changes often occur in the visible spectral region rather than in the infrared because of the sensitivity of chlorophyll to physiological disturbances. The primary basis for the detection of stress conditions in a crop or other plant community by aerial remote sensors often, however, is not a change in the reflectance characteristics of individual leaves, but a reduction in the total leaf area exposed to the sensors. This reduction can result from a direct loss of leaves, a change in their orientation, or an overall suppression of plant growth. In such cases the total infrared reflectance tends to be decreased relatively more than the visible reflectance because of a reduction in the infrared enhancement due to fewer multiple leaf layers and because of an increase in background exposure. {\textcopyright} 1970 American Elsevier Publishing Company, Inc.},

abstract = {Hyperspectral reflectance (438 to 884 nm) data were recorded at five different growth stages of winter wheat in a field experiment including two cultivars, three plant densities, and four levels of N application. All two-band combinations in the normalized difference vegetation index ($\lambda$1 - $\lambda$2)/($\lambda$1 + $\lambda$2) were subsequently used in a linear regression analysis against green biomass (GBM, g fresh weight m-2soil), leaf area index (LAI, m2green leaf m-2soil), leaf chlorophyll concentration (Chlconc, mg chlorophyll g-1leaf fresh weight), leaf chlorophyll density (Chldensity, mg chlorophyll m-2soil), leaf nitrogen concentration (Nconc, mg nitrogen g-1leaf dry weight), and leaf nitrogen density (Ndensity, g nitrogen m-2soil). A number of grouped wavebands with high correlation (R2{\textgreater}95{\%}) were revealed. For the crop variables based on quantity per unit surface area, i.e. GBM, LAI, Chldensity, and Ndensity, these wavebands had in the majority (87{\%}) of the cases a center wavelength in the red edge spectral region from 680 to 750 nm and the band combinations were often paired so that both bands were closely spaced in the steep linear shift between Rredand Rnir. The red edge region was almost absent for bands related to Chlconcand Nconc, where the visible spectral range, mainly in the blue region, proved to be better. The selected narrow-band indices improved the description of the influence of all six-crop variables compared to the traditional broad- and short-band indices normally applied on data from satellite, aerial photos, and field spectroradiometers. For variables expressed on the basis of soil or canopy surface area, the relationship was further improved when exponential curve fitting was used instead of linear regression. The best of the selected narrow-band indices was compared to the results of a partial least square regression (PLS). This comparison showed that the narrow-band indices related to LAI and Chlconc, and to some extent also Chldensityand Ndensity, were optimal and could not be significantly improved by PLS using the information from all wavelengths in the hyperspectral region. However, PLS improved the prediction of GBM and Nconcby lowering the RMSE with 22{\%} and 24{\%}, respectively, compared to the best narrow-band indices. It is concluded that PLS regression analysis may provide a useful exploratory and predictive tool when applied on hyperspectral reflectance data. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {Remote sensing has gained much attention for agronomic applications such as crop management or yield estimation. Crop phenotyping under field conditions has recently become another important application that requires specific needs: the considered remote-sensing method must be (1) as accurate as possible so that slight differences in phenotype can be detected and related to genotype, and (2) robust so that thousands of cultivars potentially quite different in terms of plant architecture can be characterized with a similar accuracy over different years and soil and weather conditions. In this study, the potential of nadir and off-nadir ground-based spectro-radiometric measurements to remotely sense five plant traits relevant for field phenotyping, namely, the leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, and canopy chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, was evaluated over fourteen sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) cultivars, two years and three study sites. Among the diversity of existing remote-sensing methods, two popular approaches based on various selected Vegetation Indices (VI) and PROSAIL inversion were compared, especially in the perspective of using them for phenotyping applications. Overall, both approaches are promising to remotely estimate LAI and canopy chlorophyll content (RMSE≤10{\%}). In addition, VIs show a great potential to retrieve canopy nitrogen content (RMSE=10{\%}). On the other hand, the estimation of leaf-level quantities is less accurate, the best accuracy being obtained for leaf chlorophyll content estimation based on VIs (RMSE=17{\%}). As expected when observing the relationship between leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen contents, poor correlations are found between VIs and mass-based or area-based leaf nitrogen content. Importantly, the estimation accuracy is strongly dependent on sun-sensor geometry, the structural and biochemical plant traits being generally better estimated based on nadir and off-nadir observations, respectively. Ultimately, a preliminary comparison tends to indicate that, providing that enough samples are included in the calibration set, (1) VIs provide slightly more accurate performances than PROSAIL inversion, (2) VIs and PROSAIL inversion do not show significant differences in robustness across the different cultivars and years. Even if more data are still necessary to draw definitive conclusions, the results obtained with VIs are promising in the perspective of high-throughput phenotyping using UAV-embedded multispectral cameras, with which only a few wavebands are available.},

abstract = {Field-based plant phenomics requires robust crop sensing platforms and data analysis tools to successfully identify cultivars that exhibit phenotypes with high agronomic and economic importance. Such efforts will lead to genetic improvements that maintain high crop yield with concomitant tolerance to environmental stresses. The objectives of this study were to investigate proximal hyperspectral sensing with a field spectroradiometer and to compare data analysis approaches for estimating four cotton phenotypes: leaf water content (Cw), specific leaf mass (Cm), leaf chlorophyll a+b content (Cab), and leaf area index (LAI). Field studies tested 25 Pima cotton cultivars grown under well-watered and water-limited conditions in central Arizona from 2010 to 2012. Several vegetation indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), and the physiological (or photochemical) reflectance index (PRI) were compared with partial least squares regression (PLSR) approaches to estimate the four phenotypes. Additionally, inversion of the PROSAIL plant canopy reflectance model was investigated to estimate phenotypes based on 3.68 billion PROSAIL simulations on a supercomputer. Phenotypic estimates from each approach were compared with field measurements, and hierarchical linear mixed modeling was used to identify differences in the estimates among the cultivars and water levels. The PLSR approach performed best and estimated Cw,Cm,Cab, and LAI with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) between measured and modeled values of 6.8{\%}, 10.9{\%}, 13.1{\%}, and 18.5{\%}, respectively. Using linear regression with the vegetation indices, no index estimated Cw,Cm,Cab, and LAI with RMSEs better than 9.6{\%}, 16.9{\%}, 14.2{\%}, and 28.8{\%}, respectively. PROSAIL model inversion could estimate Cab and LAI with RMSEs of about 16{\%} and 29{\%}, depending on the objective function. However, the RMSEs for Cw and Cm from PROSAIL model inversion were greater than 30{\%}. Compared to PLSR, advantages to the physically-based PROSAIL model include its ability to simulate the canopy's bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and to estimate phenotypes from canopy spectral reflectance without a training data set. All proximal hyperspectral approaches were able to identify differences in phenotypic estimates among the cultivars and irrigation regimes tested during the field studies. Improvements to these proximal hyperspectral sensing approaches could be realized with a high-throughput phenotyping platform able to rapidly collect canopy spectral reflectance data from multiple view angles.},

abstract = {Many hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs) have been developed to estimate crop nitrogen (N) status at leaf and canopy levels. However, most of these indices have not been evaluated for estimating plant N concentration (PNC) of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at different growth stages using a common on-farm dataset. The objective of this study was to evaluate published VIs for estimating PNC of winter wheat in the North China Plain for different growth stages and years using data from both N experiments and farmers' fields, and to identify alternative promising hyperspectral VIs through a thorough evaluation of all possible two band combinations in the range of 350-1075 nm. Three field experiments involving different winter wheat cultivars and 4-6 N rates were conducted with cooperative farmers from 2005 to 2007 in Shandong Province, China. Data from 69 farmers' fields were also collected to evaluate further the published and newly identified hyperspectral VIs. The results indicated that best performing published and newly identified VIs could explain 51{\%} (R700/R670) and 57{\%} (R418/R405), respectively, of the variation in PNC at later growth stages (Feekes 8-10), but only 22{\%} (modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index, MCARI) and 43{\%} (R763/R761), respectively, at the early stages (Feekes 4-7). Red edge and near infrared (NIR) bands were more effective for PNC estimation at Feekes 4-7, but visible bands, especially ultraviolet, violet and blue bands, were more sensitive at Feekes 8-10. Across site-years, cultivars and growth stages, the combination of R370 and R400 as either simple ratio or a normalized difference index performed most consistently in both experimental (R2 = 0. 58) and farmers' fields (R2 = 0. 51). We conclude that growth stage has a significant influence on the performance of different vegetation indices and the selection of sensitive wavelengths for PNC estimation, and new approaches need to be developed for monitoring N status at early growth stages. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

In FERR, a feature vector is defined in each spectral band using the mean of all classes in that dimension. Then, it is modelled using a linear combination of its farthest neighbours from among other defined feature vectors. The representation coefficients obtained by solving the ridge regression model compose the projection matrix for feature extraction. FERR can extract each desired number of features while the other methods such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) have limitations in the number of extracted features. Experimental results on four popular real hyperspectral images show that the efficiency of FERR is superior to those of other supervised feature extraction methods in small sample-size situations.

These indices have been widely implemented within RS applications using different airborne and satellite platforms with recent advances using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Up to date, there is no unified mathematical expression that defines all VIs due to the complexity of different light spectra combinations, instrumentation, platforms, and resolutions used. Therefore, customized algorithms have been developed and tested against a variety of applications according to specific mathematical expressions that combine visible light radiation, mainly green spectra region, from vegetation, and nonvisible spectra to obtain proxy quantifications of the vegetation surface. In the real-world applications, optimization VIs are usually tailored to the specific application requirements coupled with appropriate validation tools and methodologies in the ground. The present study introduces the spectral characteristics of vegetation and summarizes the development of VIs and the advantages and disadvantages from different indices developed. This paper reviews more than 100 VIs, discussing their specific applicability and representativeness according to the vegetation of interest, environment, and implementation precision. Predictably, research, and development of VIs, which are based on hyperspectral and UAV platforms, would have a wide applicability in different areas.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables. We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure. The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach.},

abstract = {Abstract  The task of modeling the distribution of a large number of tree species under future climate scenarios presents unique challenges. First, the model must be robust enough to handle climate data outside the current range without producing unacceptable instability in the output. In addition, the technique should have automatic search mechanisms built in to select the most appropriate values for input model parameters for each species so that minimal effort is required when these parameters are fine-tuned for individual tree species. We evaluated four statistical models—Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees (BT), Random Forests (RF), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)—for predictive vegetation mapping under current and future climate scenarios according to the Canadian Climate Centre global circulation model. To test, we applied these techniques to four tree species common in the eastern United States: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and white oak (Quercus alba). When the four techniques were assessed with Kappa and fuzzy Kappa statistics, RF and BT were superior in reproducing current importance value (a measure of basal area in addition to abundance) distributions for the four tree species, as derived from approximately 100,000 USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis plots. Future estimates of suitable habitat after climate change were visually more reasonable with BT and RF, with slightly better performance by RF as assessed by Kappa statistics, correlation estimates, and spatial distribution of importance values. Although RTA did not perform as well as BT and RF, it provided interpretive models for species whose distributions were captured well by our current set of predictors. MARS was adequate for predicting current distributions but unacceptable for future climate. We consider RTA, BT, and RF modeling approaches, especially when used together to take advantage of their individual strengths, to be robust for predictive mapping and recommend their inclusion in the ecological toolbox.},

abstract = {Nitrogen available to support corn (Zea mays L.) production can be highly variable within fields. Canopy reflectance sensing for assessing crop N health has been proposed as a technology to base side-dress variable-rate N application. Objectives of this research were to evaluate the use of active-light crop-canopy reflectance sensors for assessing corn N need, and derive the N fertilizer rate that would return the maximum profit relative to a single producer-selected N application rate. A total of 16 field-scale experiments were conducted over four seasons (2004-2007) in three major soil areas. Multiple blocks of randomized N rate response plots traversed the length of the field. Each block consisted of eight treatments from 0 to 235 kg N ha-1 on 34 kg N ha-1 increments, side-dressed between the V7-V11 vegetative growth stages. Canopy sensor measurements were obtained from these blocks and adjacent N-rich reference strips at the time of side-dressing. Within fields, the range of optimal N rate varied by {\textgreater}100 kg N ha-1 in 13 of 16 fields. A sufficiency index (SI) calculated from the sensor readings correlated with optimal N rate, but only in 50{\%} of the fields. As fertilizer cost increased relative to grain price, so did the value of using canopy sensors. While soil type, fertilizer cost, and corn price all affected our analysis, a modest ({\$}25 to {\$}50 ha-1) profit using canopy sensing was found. These results affirm that, for many fields, crop-canopy reflectance sensing has potential for improving N management over con-ventional single-rate applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Society of Agronomy.},
